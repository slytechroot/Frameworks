To comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), organizations must implement security controls aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, particularly NIST SP 800-53. Here are some top security controls for FISMA compliance:
1. Access Control (AC)

    Principle of Least Privilege: Limit user access to the minimum necessary data and system functionality.
    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Required for access to sensitive systems and information.
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define roles to ensure users have access only to what they need.

2. Audit and Accountability (AU)

    Logging and Monitoring: Enable detailed logging of system activities for audits and investigations.
    Regular Log Review: Conduct automated log analysis and review for suspicious activity.
    Retention of Audit Logs: Keep logs for a defined period to support investigations and meet compliance requirements.

3. Configuration Management (CM)

    Baseline Configuration: Establish secure baseline configurations for all systems.
    Configuration Change Control: Use formal processes to manage changes to system configurations.
    Continuous Monitoring: Regularly scan for and remediate misconfigurations and unauthorized changes.

4. Incident Response (IR)

    Incident Response Plan: Develop and implement a formal incident response plan with defined roles and processes.
    Incident Detection and Reporting: Use tools for threat detection and a process for timely incident reporting.
    Regular Incident Response Testing: Conduct tabletop exercises and incident simulations to improve response readiness.

5. Risk Assessment (RA)

    Periodic Risk Assessments: Conduct risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and prioritize risks.
    Vulnerability Management: Use vulnerability scanning and patch management to reduce risk exposure.
    Risk Mitigation: Implement strategies to address identified risks, prioritizing high-impact areas.

6. System and Information Integrity (SI)

    Malware Protection: Deploy and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software.
    Security Monitoring: Use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools for real-time monitoring.
    Patch Management: Establish a patching schedule to address vulnerabilities promptly.

7. Contingency Planning (CP)

    Data Backup: Regularly back up data and systems in secure locations.
    Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP): Develop a DRP to restore operations after a security incident or disaster.
    Regular Testing: Test contingency and recovery plans to ensure reliability during actual incidents.

8. System and Communications Protection (SC)

    Encryption: Encrypt data at rest and in transit, especially sensitive information.
    Boundary Defense: Use firewalls, IDS/IPS, and VPNs to secure network perimeters.
    Network Segmentation: Segment networks to limit access and reduce lateral movement within the system.

These controls help ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability within federal systems and meet FISMAâ€™s robust security requirements.
